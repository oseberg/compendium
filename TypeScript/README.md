A **data type** or simply *type* is a **classification of data** which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

Common data types include:

* Integers: [1, 56, 7]
* Booleans: [true, false]
* Characters: [ . , -]
* floating-point numbers: [1.618]
* alphanumeric strings: [9e379fcd]

## TypeScript

A superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static *typing*, *classes* and *interfaces*. It enables IDEs to provide a richer environment for spotting common errors as you type the code.

**Types**

Type system: “A set of rules that assigns a property called a ‘type’ to the various constructs of a computer program such as variables, expressions, functions, or modules. These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer users for algebraic data types, data structures, or other components. 
...The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way" -Wikipedia
